# ProjectRecipeMe

Author: Steve Montelongo

ProjectRecipeMe is a recipe fetching application that helps the user choose recipes based on their ingredient inventory.
The full application will involve several steps to accurately track available recipes.
1. The user will create a grocery list from the available ingredient list in the application.
2. The user will obtain the ingredients while checking off the ingredients in the list. As the ingredients are check off, they will automatically be added to the user's online fridge.
3. The user will then refresh the recipes screen, and the recipes based on the available ingredients in the user's online fridge will update.
4. The user will then click on a recipe, confirm to the application that the recipe will be made, and then the application will deduct the required ingredients from the user's online fridge if selected.

## Notes

This is my passion project in which I implemented the Android knowledge I've learned throughout the years. This project started as an attempt to create a solution to a problem
my family had with grocery shopping organization and meal planning. Working on this project has been a rewarding experience and I've learned through the many roadblocks and obstacles.
